It is not possible to select the first second third ..... element in a class by class name

This it not possible to use the CSS3 selector :first-of-type to select the first element with a given class name.

<!-- Is it possible to use the CSS3 selector :first-of-type to select the first element with a given class name? I haven't been successful with my test so I'm thinking it's not?

The Code (http://jsfiddle.net/YWY4L/): -->


<div>
  <div>This text should appear as normal</div>
  <p>This text should be blue.</p>
  <p class="myclass1">This text should appear red.</p>
  <p class="myclass2">This text should appear green.</p>
</div>

<style type="text/css">
	p:first-of-type {color:blue}
p.myclass1:first-of-type {color:red}
.myclass2:first-of-type {color:green}
</style>


<!-- No, it's not possible using just one selector. The :first-of-type pseudo-class selects the first element of its type (div, p, etc). Using a class selector (or a type selector) with that pseudo-class means to select an element if it has the given class (or is of the given type) and is the first of its type among its siblings.
 -->
<!-- Unfortunately, CSS doesn't provide a :first-of-class selector that only chooses the first occurrence of a class. As a workaround, you can use something like this:
 -->
 <style type="text/css">
.myclass1 { color: red; }
.myclass1 ~ .myclass1 { color: /* default, or inherited from parent div */; }
</style>
